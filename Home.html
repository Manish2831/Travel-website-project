                  <p class="text-gray">The River House echoes a stately old Colonial bungalow. The rooms are large, with soaring ceiling and furniture that have been customized and handcrafted on site, following the old traditions. The common spaces are thoughtfully arranged to balance camaraderie with privacy, and the home-styled meals are fashioned from the bounty of the land, with a little help from our own kitchen garden.</p>

                <p class="text-gray">The dining experience at the River House echoes an older time, when the menu was decided based on what was the harvest of the day. We source our produce fresh from farmers from around the village and supplement it with the catch of the day and our own kitchen garden.

                    Our kitchen is extraordinarily flexible, providing almost an exclusive butler service experience –
                    given a little notice, our chef can whip up anything you want.</p>

                     <p>From the road, the River House could easily be mistaken for a Planter’s home, and we’re quite proud of that. Sitting on a little terraced clearing right by the water and surrounded by rubber estates, the River House is an oasis of calm. The House itself is built on the highest point with the gardens running down to the pool and dining hall which overlook the river.</p>

                     <h2 class="md-heading">Riverhouse Rooms</h2> 
                     <p>The house is built on the sloped terrains of the lands and has an upper and lower floor; four of our rooms overlooking the expansive garden on either corners on both floors. The rooms are large airy and bright, finished in traditional terra cotta tiles, and handcrafted furniture.We don’t advise swimming in the river, but it’s a lovely spot to do a little fishing in the shade. If you feel like it,</p>

                    <p>For most of the year, the river is calm. It is a tributary of the Periyar, running down the hills before joining another tributary downstream to form the catchment of the Boothathankettu Dam. But during the monsoon, when the Dam’s shutters are raised and the river roars by, breaking over the boulders, it’s a sight to see.If you feel like it, you can join our neighbor </p>
